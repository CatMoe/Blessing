## About

MoeFilter is an antibot and utility plugin developed specifically for BungeeCord.
Can run on almost any fork you like.

## Features ‚ú®

> Antibot
  - Players connected via Geyser and Floodgate are not checked.
  - Don't need to modify the proxy bytecode file.
  - Third-party cloud services are not required.
  - No need to call the `PreLoginEvent` on the BungeeCord.
  - Each antibot module is almost customizable.
  - Don't lock your server when under attacks.
  - Stand-alone virtual server platform for filtering attacks.
  - Packet order check. Prevent spam attacks from non-Minecraft protocols.
  - Basic antibot checks like `valid username`, `reconnect`, `GeoIP`, and more...
> Translation
  - Register commands with ease. async execute, aliases, player-only operations, etc. can be done with annotations.
  - [`PlayerPostBrandEvent`](https://github.com/CatMoe/MoeFilter/blob/stray/translation/src/main/kotlin/catmoe/fallencrystal/translation/event/events/player/PlayerPostBrandEvent.kt). 
    Call a specific listener when the player sends their own client brand.
  - Easily write code that works on both [Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) and [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord). 
    Simply install MoeFilter to your server.
  - All are designed with [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/) in mind.
