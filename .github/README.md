# Blessing

Recoding of MoeFilter. Utility and anti-bot (soon) based on BungeeCord.

That being said. Most utility modules (such as config and event) are cross-platform. 
All you need to do is compile the dependencies required for the module together.

No release will be released until the antibot module is completed. 
The original MoeFilter remains in the archive branch.
You can also download it in the release.
