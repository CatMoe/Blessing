If you need to install Blessing on your proxy (e.x. BungeeCord). Please use "Blessing.jar"


If you are a developer and want to use Blessing's library.
Then redirect the modules you need into your project. (Blessing-"module".jar)

When you publish the library as a public project.
Please do not upload the package directly.
Instead, point out where you can download the package.

If you want to compile the library directly into your project.
Consider cloning the repository first and running "mvn -U clean install".
Then compile the library in your pom.xml.
