### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency warning:

You need [BungeeKotlinLib](https://github.com/LensMemory/BungeeKotlinLib).  
If without it, MoeFilter won't work.

MoeFilter now uses Kotlin 1.9.0. You can [click here](https://github.com/LensMemory/BungeeKotlinLib/releases/download/1.9.0/BungeeKotlinLib-1.9.0.jar) to download

## ‚ú® Features:
### Antibot:  
  - Players connected via geyser are not checked `Only Geyser-BungeeCord!`
  - Configurable Ping & Join mixed checks
  - Disconnect with pre-made packets to preserve performance
  - Do not call `PreLoginEvent` for clients when they are already disconnected
  - Clean console. Don't even need a log filter.
  - You can customize how all inspection modules work
  - Virtual server to prevent bot / attack bypass / overload proxy.

   Checks that have been implemented:
   - Ping & Join Combined checks.
   - Username checking (to avoid invalid or bot's username)
   - Connection domain via check
   - Geolocation (GeoIP) check
   - Check if the player is already online (Avoid forcing kick online player for same username)
   - Similar Name Check (Beta)
   - Prevent bot/player using proxy (built-in proxy scanner + third-party api)
   - Falling check in virtual server.

> The final effect depends on the working mode you choose in `antibot.conf`

### General:
- Cache message packets
    - Avoid huge overhead when sending repeatedly or to multiple players
- Full MiniMessage supports
    - Also, can use hex / gradient colors anywhere
    - (Not available for players client versions below 1.16.x and some BungeeCord(Its logger))
- Design with synchrony in mind
    - Well, we're not actually all async because in some cases it is simply not worth using async.
    - Bungeecord will never lag because of it.
- Consider it from a compatibility and performance perspective
    - Is there anything MoeFilter isn't compatible with?
    - If you really encounter such problems. You should go and open an [issue](https://github.com/CatMoe/MoeFilter/issues)
- Easy-to-use interface. Your next BungeeCord utility plugin.
    - Hey! Stop buying bells and whistles of BungeeCord forks.  
      It's not worth spending your money on those.
